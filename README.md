# Cricket: Tracing Compilation for Spherized Robots

Cricket is a library to trace the forward kinematics of spherized robots (generated through, for example, [`foam`](github.com/CoMMALab/foam/)).
It is built on [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) for forward kinematics, [CppAD](https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD) for tracing execution, [CppADCodeGen](https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen) for generating code, and [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) for computing the bounding sphere of spheres.
It was used to generate the collision checking kernels in [VAMP](https://github.com/kavrakiLab/vamp) and [pRRTC](https://github.com/CoMMALab/pRRTC).

## Compilation Instructions

See either the provided Dockerfile or follow the instructions for compilation in a Conda environment.

### Conda/Mamba Installation

Set up the environment:
```bash
micromamba env create -f environment.yaml
micromamba activate cricket
```

Build cricket:
```bash
cmake -GNinja -Bbuild .
cmake --build build
```

Run the script.
```bash
./build/fkcc_gen resources/panda.json

# Optionally format the code
clang-format -i panda_fk.hh
```

### Pip Install

Cricket also ships a Python package (the C++ library + Python bindings via [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind)). After setting up the conda env above:
```bash
pip install .
```
Or for a dev install:
```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```
This installs `cricket` as an importable module and places `fkcc_gen`, headers, and CMake config files under `<env>/lib/python3.X/site-packages/cricket/`. 
CMake builds of downstream projects can locate it via `find_package(cricket CONFIG REQUIRED)`.

### Docker Installation

Build the container:
```bash
docker build . -t cricket
```

Run the script:
```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/mount" --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" cricket:latest /mount/resources/panda.json -t /mount/panda.hh

# Optionally format the code
clang-format -i panda_fk.hh
```
Note the use of the `/mount` directory and specification of output file.

## JIT Runtime

In addition to the `fkcc_gen` CLI, cricket optionally builds a small C++ library (`cricket::cricket_jit`) that wraps clang + LLVM's ORC JIT to compile and load generated robot code at runtime.
This is used by [VAMP](https://github.com/kavrakiLab/vamp)'s `vamp.jit.load_robot(...)` to specialize a planner for an arbitrary URDF without full rebuilding.

### Building

Building the JIT library is **on by default**. It requires LLVM + Clang development libraries and a `clang` executable on `PATH` at runtime.
To disable:
```bash
cmake -GNinja -Bbuild -DCRICKET_BUILD_JIT=OFF .
```

## Python API

The Python bindings expose the code generation pipeline as functions:

```python
import cricket

opts = cricket.GenOptions(
    urdf="path/to/panda_spherized.urdf",
    srdf="path/to/panda.srdf",
    end_effector="panda_grasptarget",
    template_path=cricket.resources_dir() / "templates" / "fk_template.hh",
    data={"name": "Panda", "resolution": 32},
)
gen = cricket.generate_robot_source(opts)
print(gen.robot_name, gen.dimension, gen.n_spheres)
```

## Configuration

The script uses input JSON files that define what robot to load and what template to generate.
Cricket uses [inja](https://github.com/pantor/inja) to template code generation.
The configuration file specifies:
- The name of the robot
- Path of the URDF and SRDF relative (or absolute) to the configuration file. Note that this robot must only have spheres for collision geometry.
- The end-effector to use for attachments
- Collision checking resolution
- Output template and sub-templates to use
- Output filename

An example for the Franka Panda is given below:
```json
{
    "name": "Panda",
    "urdf": "panda/panda_spherized.urdf",
    "srdf": "panda/panda.srdf",
    "end_effector": "panda_grasptarget",
    "resolution": 32,
    "template": "templates/fk_template.hh",
    "subtemplates": [{"name": "ccfk", "template": "templates/ccfk_template.hh"}],
    "output": "panda_fk.hh"
}
```

For a custom robot, you only need to change the `name`, `urdf`, `srdf`, and `end_effector` fields.
Some notes:
- If your robot does not have an SRDF, then the script will attempt to guess the self-collisions of the robot by randomly sampling one million configurations and seeing what is always in collision and what never collides. However, this is unreliable and probably should just be done by hand.
- If you do not provide an end-effector, the last frame in the robot will be used. For serial link manipulators, this is probably the tool frame, but you should set this yourself.
- You may need to increase the collision checking resolution used (`resolution`) if your robot is especially high-dimensional (e.g., for Panda and Fetch 32 is used, for Baxter, 64).

## Using with VAMP

If you have a custom robot, you need to first spherize the robot (that is, convert the URDF collision geometry to only be spheres) either manually or using a tool like [foam](https://github.com/CoMMALab/foam/).
Then, write your configuration file as described above.
To then generate the required code for VAMP, simply use the provided `fkcc_gen` script with your desired robot configuration, e.g., for the Franka Panda:
```bash
./build/fkcc_gen panda.json

# Optionally format the code
clang-format -i panda_fk.hh
```

Then, copy this code into the `src/impl/vamp/robots/` folder in VAMP, where the other `<robot>.hh` files are:
```bash
# Assuming you have cloned the VAMP repo and it is located at ${VAMP_DIR}
cp panda_fk.hh ${VAMP_DIR}/src/impl/vamp/robots/panda.fk
```
Add your robot's name (the `name` field of the configuration JSON - note that this cannot have invalid characters for C++ struct names like `-` as it's used as the name of the struct) and the name of the `.hh` file (the `<robot>` part in `<robot>.hh`) to VAMP's `pyproject.toml`.
For the Panda, this would be:
```
VAMP_ROBOT_MODULES="panda"
VAMP_ROBOT_STRUCTS="Panda"
```
The name of the header file goes in `VAMP_ROBOT_MODULES`, and the name of the robot goes into `VAMP_ROBOT_STRUCTS`.
These are both lists that are separated by semicolons (`;`), you can add or remove whatever robots you want.
The name of your robot used in VAMP is the name of the header file (e.g., `panda`, or `ur5`); this is the "name" of the robot.

Once the header file is added and the name of the robot is added to the TOML, recompile VAMP:
```bash
pip install -e ${VAMP_DIR}
```

If you want to visualize your robot with the example scripts in VAMP, you will need to copy your robot's resources to VAMP's `resources/` folder.
For example, the Panda's URDF is stored in the `panda/` folder as `panda_spherized.urdf`.
If you've done this, now test your robot out with `scripts/random_dance.py --robot <robot>`.
For the Panda, this would be:
```bash
python scripts/random_dance.py --robot panda
```

## Available Parameters for Templates

Templating is done with [inja](https://github.com/pantor/inja).
Some templates are available in the `resources/templates` folder.
In addition to the specified input fields from the configuration file, the script provides the following output information usable in your templates:
- `n_q`: number of joint DoF.
- `n_spheres`: number of collision spheres.

- `eefk_code`, `eefk_code_vars`, `eefk_code_output`: C-style code for computing end-effector pose in position and quaternion, the number of intermediate variables used, and the number of output variables.
- `spherefk_code`, `spherefk_code_vars`, `spherefk_code_output`: C-style code for computing position of all spheres, the number of intermediate variables used, and the number of output variables.
- `ccfk_code`, `ccfk_code_vars`, `ccfk_code_output`: C-style code for computing position of all spheres and bounding spheres for collision checking, the number of intermediate variables used, and the number of output variables.
- `ccfkee_code`, `ccfkee_code_vars`, `ccfkee_code_output`: C-style code for computing position of all spheres and bounding spheres for collision checking as well as the position and quaternion for the end-effector, the number of intermediate variables used, and the number of output variables.
